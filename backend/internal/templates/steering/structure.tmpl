# Repository Structure

## Layout

- `/backend` — Backend code
- `/frontend` — Frontend code
- `/migrations` — Database migrations

## Conventions

- One concern per file
- Keep flat until nesting is necessary
- No dumping ground folders (utils/, helpers/, misc/)

## Rules

- API types live with their handlers
- DB migrations are versioned and immutable
- Frontend components organized by feature
