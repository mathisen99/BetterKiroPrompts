# Log Files

This directory contains application log files. Logs are automatically generated by the backend server and are excluded from version control.

## File Naming Convention

Log files follow the pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-{category}.log`

Categories:
- `app` - Application lifecycle events (startup, shutdown, service initialization)
- `http` - HTTP request/response logging with request IDs
- `db` - Database operations (queries, connections, migrations)
- `scanner` - Security scanner pipeline operations
- `client` - Frontend errors sent from the browser

Example: `2026-01-13-http.log`

## Log Levels

Logs support four severity levels (configurable via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable):

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `DEBUG` | Detailed debugging information, includes request previews |
| `INFO` | General operational information (default) |
| `WARN` | Warning conditions that don't prevent operation |
| `ERROR` | Error conditions that may require attention |

## Retention Policy

- **Maximum file size**: 100MB per log file
- **Rotation**: When a file exceeds 100MB, it's rotated with a timestamp suffix
- **Retention**: Log files are automatically cleaned up after 7 days

## Log Format

Logs are written in JSON format for structured parsing:

```json
{
  "time": "2026-01-13T10:30:00.000Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "msg": "request_complete",
  "component": "http",
  "request_id": "abc123",
  "status": 200,
  "duration": "45ms"
}
```

## Sensitive Data

Sensitive fields (passwords, tokens, API keys, secrets, authorization headers) are automatically redacted in log output.

## Docker Mount

In Docker environments, this directory is mounted from the host at `./logs:/app/logs` to persist logs outside containers.
